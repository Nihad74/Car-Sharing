## Log in as a Manager

- Users can create companies and let them print as a company list
- By selecting a company, a user can create a car that belongs to that company and view the car list of every company

## Log in as a Customer
- User can select a customer that has been created or create a new customer
- By selecting a customer, a user can then choose whether he likes to rent a car, return the rented car or show information about the rented car
- If a user already rented a car he can't rent another car. He has to return his current car first.
- If a user wants to rent a car he has to select a company first and then only the available cars from that company will be shown to him i.e. the cars of that specific company which are not rented by other customers
